# WhatTheBook
This project is an Android Basics with Compose App. 

The app takes a user input and searches the Google Books API using Retrofit 2 and displays a grid of book covers with optional details.

This project really tested my knowledge of making apps in Android Studio! There were a lot of challenges that I eventually overcame! 

For a good feel and user experience I have added in some elements of Animation that I have researched in addition to the basic app functionality.


I used the data layer of the app to: 
- Create a Retrofit service to get data from the Google Books API.
- Add methods for the service to get a list of books and get information about a specific book.
- Use Gson to extract meaningful data from the JSON response returned by the API.
